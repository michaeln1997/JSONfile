# JSONfile
It is a website that we created that helps to convert JSON files to .txt format, and run the .txt format in an application which is written in C# programming language.

we created this website for a client because he wanted to show his students how FBI or police could get information about us quickly, so students need to download their own google takeout and submit it in the application, so we could interpret and print their information in a readable way for them.
